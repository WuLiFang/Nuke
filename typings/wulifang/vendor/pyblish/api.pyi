"""
Use this in plugins, integrations and extensions of Pyblish.
This part of the library is what will change the least and
attempt to maintain backwards- and forwards-compatibility.

This way, we as developers are free to refactor the library
without breaking any of your tools.

.. note:: Contributors, don't use this in any other module internal
    to Pyblish or a cyclic dependency will be created. This is only
    to be used by end-users of the library and from
    integrations/extensions of Pyblish.
