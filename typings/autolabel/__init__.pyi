    """This function is run automatically by Nuke during idle, and the return
    text is drawn on the box of the node. It can also have side effects by
    setting knobs. Currently two knobs are provided that are useful:

    indicators = integer bit flags to turn icons on/off. The icons
    named indicator1, indicator2, indicator4, indicator8, etc are
    drawn if the corresponding bit is on. By default these are loaded
    from the path as indicator1.xpm, etc, but you can use the load_icon
    command to load other files.

    icon = name of a whole extra image you can draw, but it replaces
    any previous one."""
